Data layers were converted into raster data as needed, with a 30m resolution, matching the SRTM elevation raster (see @sec-elev).\n\n#### Elevation {#sec-elev}\n\nHigher elevations are at lower flood risk due to naturally occurring drainage, frequently in the form of surface runoff. While lower elevations have higher surface water flow accumulation (**CITATION NEEDED**) which can promote infiltration (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nElevation data acquired from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30m resolution global Digital Elevation Model (DEM), accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE) (**DATA CITATION**).\n\n![San Pedro elevation 30m NASA SRTM.](images/SanPedro_Elev.png){#fig-elev}\n\n#### Slope\n\nSteeper slopes tend to promote surface flow and high erosion. Gentler slopes however have decreased surface water flow rates, increasing residence time, and potentially resulting in flooding during times of heavy rainfall or snowmelt (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nSlope data was calculated as a first order derivative of the elevation data.\n\n![San Pedro slope.](images/SanPedro_Slope.png){#fig-slope}\n\n#### Lineament Density\n\nLineaments such as faults and fractures fundamentally influence water flow dynamics.\n\n**This layer is not yet available, but I believe that Ryan is working on this concept**\n\nSee @aloui2024 section 3.1.3 Lineament density (LD) for additional methods on generating lineament features from a DEM.\n\n#### Drainage Density\n\nHigh drainage density increases flood susceptibility via rapid water accumulation through channels (**CITATION NEEDED**). Additionally, the increased flow rate in areas with high drainage density reduces the residence time of surface water, limiting recharge potential (**CITATION NEEDED**) and regions of high drainage density have been frequently associated with less permiable soils (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nDrainage density was calculated using the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flowline features (**Data Citation**). This dataset consisted of both natural and engineered flowlines, including such things as underground pipes. Line density was calculated in Km of flowline per KmÂ², using a search kernel of 1 Km.\n\n![San Pedro drainage density.
