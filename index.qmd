## Introduction

Please see [Identifying suitable zones for integrated aquifer recharge and flood control in arid Qatar using GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352801X24000602#bib49) [@aloui2024]

### Study Area

![San Pedro watershed, study area.](images/SanPedro_Reference_Painted.png){#fig-studyArea}

## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}

### Thematic Layers

All data layers were processed in ArcGIS Pro v3.4.0 unless otherwise indicated. Data layers were converted into raster data as needed, with a 30m resolution, matching the SRTM elevation raster (see @sec-elev).

#### Elevation {#sec-elev}

Higher elevations are at lower flood risk due to naturally occurring drainage, frequently in the form of surface runoff. While lower elevations have higher surface water flow accumulation (**CITATION NEEDED**) which can promote infiltration (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Elevation data acquired from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30m resolution global Digital Elevation Model (DEM), accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE) (**DATA CITATION**).

![San Pedro elevation 30m NASA SRTM.](images/SanPedro_Elev.png){#fig-elev}

#### Slope

Steeper slopes tend to promote surface flow and high erosion. Gentler slopes however have decreased surface water flow rates, increasing residence time, and potentially resulting in flooding during times of heavy rainfall or snowmelt (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Slope data was calculated as a first order derivative of the elevation data.

![San Pedro slope.](images/SanPedro_Slope.png){#fig-slope}

#### Lineament Density

Lineaments such as faults and fractures fundamentally influence water flow dynamics (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Lineament density derived from the SRTM layer by application of a mean filter with circular radius of 100 m. This smoothed raster was then subtracted from the original SRTM to create a topographic position index (TPI). The TPI image was then imported into Catalyst (**PCI GEOMATICA SOFTWARE CITATION**) where a segment tracing line algorithm was performed. Roads and stream flowlines were then buffered and subsequently erased from the lineaments, leaving natural faults and other geographic features.  Additional details on lineament generation (**Ryan**).

As with the Lithology layer (see below), the lineaments data layer ends abruptly at the US-Mexico border.

Lineament density was calculated as line density in Km of fault per Km², using a 1Km search kernel.

![San Pedro lineament density. Line density calculated using a 1 Km search kernel. ](images/SanPedro_Lineaments.png)

#### Drainage Density

High drainage density increases flood susceptibility via rapid water accumulation through channels (**CITATION NEEDED**). Additionally, the increased flow rate in areas with high drainage density reduces the residence time of surface water, limiting recharge potential (**CITATION NEEDED**) and regions of high drainage density have been frequently associated with less permeable soils (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Drainage density was calculated using the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flowline features (**Data Citation**). This dataset consisted of both natural and engineered flowlines, including such things as underground pipes. Line density was calculated in Km of flowline per Km², using a search kernel of 1 Km.

![San Pedro drainage density. Line density calculated using a 1 Km search kernel.](images/SanPedro_DrainDense.png){#fig-drain}

#### Precipitation

Precipitation is the primary source of freshwater for aquifer recharge, as well as being the prevailing force driving regional flooding (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Precipitation data was obtained from OSU PRISM data using 30-year normals 800 m resolution, subsequently downscaled to match the SRTM 30 m resolution using bilinear interpolation (**DATA CITATION**). The PRISM dataset extends approximately 10 Km S of the US-Mexico border, but unfortunately it does not cover the entire watershed. The extent of the uncovered portion of the watershed is approximately 1,200 Km², representing roughly 12% of the total area.

::: callout-note
*In the San Pedro watershed precipitation is highly correlated with elevation. Using a simple linear trend line across the entire watershed elevation accounts for 51% of the variance in precipitation, increasing to 81% when using an E-W transect located at the US-Mexico border (data not shown). This corelation could potentially be leveraged to fill in the missing data through a variety of interpolation techniques.*

#### Lithology

The characteristics of surface rock profoundly impact recharge, as the primary factor governing permeability (**CITATION NEEDED**).

Lithology data from the USGS State Geologic Map Compilation (**DATA CITATION**). Depending on how the geologic units are defined (i.e. by "Unit Name", primary, secondary, tertiary lithology, or combination) there are upwards of 25 distinct geologic units which must be classified. The USGS SGMC terminates at the US-Mexico border, and it is not clear if any relevant data within Mexico can be located. The extent of the uncovered portion of the watershed is approximately 1,800 Km², representing roughly 16% of the total area.

::: callout-warning
**This method of classification, already arduous for San Pedro, with 25 unique categories, will not be scalable to the broader study area (245 unique categories). It would be advisable to alter this classification to "GENERALIZE" (19 unique categories), or some other classification schema TBD.**

#### Soil Type

Soil texture influences infiltration via it's impacts on porosity and adhesion (**CITATION NEEDED**). Finer soil textures increase runoff, reducing infiltration, and visa versa (**CITATION NEEDED**).

**Original soil data source unknown. Presumably USGS Soil Survey(?). PLEASE ADVISE!**

Soil type is classified into 1 of 7 soil hydrologic groups... *Additional details about classification methods*

As with the USGS lithology data, the soils data ends abruptly at the US-Mexico border. At this time data availability within Mexico has not been identified.

These USGS(?) classifications were assigned an additional suitability classification ranking from 1-5 according to @tbl-soil

| Class | Count (pixels)\* | Text | Flooding Susceptibility | Recharge Suitability |
|:------------|:------------|:------------------------------|------------:|------------:|
| A | 62559472 | Group A soils consist of deep, well drained sands or gravelly sands with high infiltration and low runoff rates. | 1 | 5 |
| B | 76665198 | Group B soils consist of deep well drained soils with a moderately fine to moderately coarse texture and a moderate rate of infiltration and runoff. | 3 | 4 |
| C | 88491710 | Group C consists of soils with a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or fine textured soils and a slow rate of infiltration. | 4 | 2 |
| D | 155095790 | Group D consists of soils with a very slow infiltration rate and high runoff potential. This group is composed of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils with a high water table, soils that have a clay pan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. | 5 | 1 |
| A/D | 43192 | Group A/D soils naturally have a very slow infiltration rate due to a high water table but will have high infiltration and low runoff rates if drained. | 3 | 4 |

#### NDVI
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a proxy for vegetation health and cover. High NDVI reduces flood risk and promotes infiltration due to vegetation's ability to reduce surface runoff flow rate, and create macro-pores in the soil (**CITATION NEEDED**).

NDVI is a highly seasonally dependent index. To account for normal seasonal variation, a 10-year mean NDVI was calculated using Landsat 8 and 9 imagery from early 2013 (launch of LS-8) through 2023 (**DATA CITATION**). NDVI preprocessing and analysis was carried out in Google Earth Engine using the Javascript editor.

#### Land use/land cover
Infiltration and runoff rates are highly influenced by land cover (**CITATION NEEDED**). ESRI 2020 Global Land Use Land Cover from Sentinel-2 (ESRI LULC) is a 10-m resolution global land cover dataset derived from proprietary machine-learning algorithm run on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (**DATA CITATION**). ESRI LULC was accessed and clipped to the study area using Google Earth Engine. The pixel resolution was reduced to 30 m.

```default
// Land Use Land Cover
// Travis Zalesky
// ATUR
// 11/14/24

var studyArea = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-travisz09/assets/ATUR/WBDHU8_OuterBoundary_Project");

var esri_lulc10 = ee.ImageCollection("projects/sat-io/open-datasets/landcover/ESRI_Global-LULC_10m")
  .filterBounds(studyArea)
  .mosaic()
  .clip(studyArea);
  
print(esri_lulc10)

Export.image.toDrive({
  image: esri_lulc10, 
  description: 'ESRI_LULC_10m_mergedClipped',
  folder: 'ATUR/Data',
  fileNamePrefix: 'ESRI_LULC_10m_clip',
  region: studyArea,
  scale: 30,
  crs: 'EPSG:32612',
  maxPixels: 1e12
})
```
Following extraction from GEE. LULC was classified from 1-5 according to @tbl-lulc.

#### Stormwater Drainage Density

**I am unaware of any data availability for this layer. PLEASE ADVISE!**

::: callout-note
*I was able to locate sewer data for [Sierra Vista](https://cosvazgis-sierravista.hub.arcgis.com/maps/bd8411bd3f1a485395f057636aa94b09/explore?location=31.560760%2C-110.206043%2C-1.00), the largest city in the San Pedro watershed. It is unclear if this layer includes stormwater drains as well as domestic treated sewage, or if the two systems are integrated. Additionally, I was not able to locate sewer data from any other cities/towns/municipalities in the region.*

*Additionally, this data may be available through Cochise County, but is not publicly available. While it may be possible to reach out to Cochise County representatives to obtain such data, this would not be a scalable approach for the entire state.*

*Due to the uncertain nature of the available data, as well as it's limited extent, I am inclined to skip this layer for the purposes of this analysis, unless otherwise instructed. I remain open to suggestions for additional or alternative data sources.*
