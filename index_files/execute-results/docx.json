Data layers were converted into raster data as needed, with a 30m resolution, matching the SRTM elevation raster (see @sec-elev).\n\n#### Elevation {#sec-elev}\n\nHigher elevations are at lower flood risk due to naturally occurring drainage, frequently in the form of surface runoff. While lower elevations have higher surface water flow accumulation (**CITATION NEEDED**) which can promote infiltration (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nElevation data acquired from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30m resolution global Digital Elevation Model (DEM), accessed via Google Earth Engine (GEE) (**DATA CITATION**).\n\n![San Pedro elevation 30m NASA SRTM.](images/SanPedro_Elev.png){#fig-elev}\n\n#### Slope\n\nSteeper slopes tend to promote surface flow and high erosion. Gentler slopes however have decreased surface water flow rates, increasing residence time, and potentially resulting in flooding during times of heavy rainfall or snowmelt (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nSlope data was calculated as a first order derivative of the elevation data.\n\n![San Pedro slope.](images/SanPedro_Slope.png){#fig-slope}\n\n#### Lineament Density\n\nLineaments such as faults and fractures fundamentally influence water flow dynamics.\n\n**This layer is not yet available, but I believe that Ryan is working on this concept**\n\nSee @aloui2024 section 3.1.3 Lineament density (LD) for additional methods on generating lineament features from a DEM.\n\n#### Drainage Density\n\nHigh drainage density increases flood susceptibility via rapid water accumulation through channels (**CITATION NEEDED**). Additionally, the increased flow rate in areas with high drainage density reduces the residence time of surface water, limiting recharge potential (**CITATION NEEDED**) and regions of high drainage density have been frequently associated with less permiable soils (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nDrainage density was calculated using the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flowline features (**Data Citation**). This dataset consisted of both natural and engineered flowlines, including such things as underground pipes. Line density was calculated in Km of flowline per Km², using a search kernel of 1 Km.\n\n![San Pedro drainage density. Line density calculated using a 1 Km search kernel.](images/SanPedro_DrainDense.png){#fig-drain}\n\n#### Precipitation\n\nPrecipitation is the primary source of freshwater for aquifer recharge, as well as being the prevailing force driving regional flooding (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nPrecipitation data was obtained from OSU PRISM data using 30-year normals 800 m resolution, subsequently downscaled to match the SRTM 30 m resolution using bilinear interpolation (**DATA CITATION**). The PRISM dataset extends approximately 10 Km S of the US-Mexico border, but unfortunately it does not cover the entire watershed. The extent of the uncovered portion of the watershed is approximately 1,200 Km², representing roughly 12% of the total area.\n\n::: callout-note\n*In the San Pedro watershed precipitation is highly correlated with elevation. Using a simple linear trendline across the entire watershed elevation accounts for 51% of the variance in precipitation, increasing to 81% when using an E-W transect located at the US-Mexico border (data not shown). This corelation could potentially be leveraged to fill in the missing data through a variety of interpolation techniques.*\n:::\n\n![San Pedro average annual precipitation.

Depending on how the geologic units are defined (i.e. by \"Unit Name\", primary, secondary, tertiary lithology, or combination) there are upwards of 25 distinct geologic units which must be classified. The USGS SGMC terminates at the US-Mexico border, and it is not clear if any relevant data within Mexico can be located. The extent of the uncovered portion of the watershed is approximately 1,800 Km², representing roughly 16% of the total area.\n\n##### **PLEASE ADVISE!**\n\n| Geologic Unit Name | Suitability Classification (1-10) |\n|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n| Early Proterozoic granitic rocks |  |\n| Quaternary surficial deposits, undivided |  |\n| Early Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks |  |\n| Pliocene to middle Miocene deposits |  |\n| Early Tertiary to Late Cretaceous granitic rocks |  |\n| Middle Proterozoic diabase |  |\n| Cretaceous to Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks with minor volcanic rocks |  |\n| Mississippian, Devonian, and Cambrian sedimentary rocks |  |\n| Paleozoic sedimentary rocks |  |\n| Early Tertiary to Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks |  |\n| Jurassic volcanic rocks |  |\n| Middle Miocene to Oligocene granitic rocks |  |\n| Middle Miocene to Oligocene volcanic rocks |  |\n| Jurassic granitic rocks |  |\n| Early Proterozoic metamorphic rocks |  |\n| Early Tertiary to Late Cretaceous muscovite-bearing granitic rocks |  |\n| Holocene surficial deposits |  |\n| Middle Miocene to Oligocene sedimentary rocks |  |\n| Early Pleistocene to latest Pliocene surficial deposits |  |\n| Middle Proterozoic sedimentary rocks |  |\n| Middle Proterozoic granitic rocks |  |\n| Permian to Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks |  |\n| Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks |  |\n| Tertiary to Early Proterozoic gneissic rocks |  |\n| Holocene river alluvium |  |\n\n![San Pedro lithology.](images/SanPedro_Lith.png){#fig-lith}\n\n#### Soil Type\n\nSoil texture influences infiltration via it's impacts on porosity and adhesion (**CITATION NEEDED**). Finer soil textures increase runoff, reducing infiltration, and visa versa (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\n**Original soil data source unknown. Presumably USGS Soil Survey(?). PLEASE ADVISE!**\n\nSoil type is classified into 1 of 7 soil hydrologic groups... *Additional details about classification methods*\n\nAs with the USGS lithology data, the soils data ends abruptly at the US-Mexico border.

High NDVI reduces flood risk and promotes infiltration due to vegetation's ability to reduce surface runoff flow rate, and create macro-pores in the soil (**CITATION NEEDED**).\n\nNDVI is a highly seasonally dependent index. To account for normal seasonal variation, a 10-year mean NDVI was calculated using Landsat 8 and 9 imagery from early 2013 (launch of LS-8) through 2023 (**DATA CITATION**). NDVI preprocessing and analysis was carried out in Google Earth Engine using the Javascript editor.\n\n```default\n// San Pedro NDVI\n// Travis Zalesky\n// ATUR\n// 11/14/24\n// \n\n// Import module for usefull landsat functions\nvar landsatFunctions = require('users/travisz09/UsefulFunctions:LandsatFunctions')\n\n// Study Area\nprint('San Pedro', sanPedro);\n\n// Map setup\nMap.centerObject(sanPedro, 8);\n\nMap.addLayer(ee.Image().byte().paint(sanPedro, 'black', 2), {}, 'San Pedro');\n\n// Study period\nvar startDate = '2013-01-01';  // First year of LS-8\nvar endDate = '2024-01-01';  // Exclusive end date\n\n// Landsat coll\nvar cloudFilter = 10;  // 10% max cloud cover\nvar landsat  = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2')\n  // Combine Lst-9 and Lst-8\n  .merge(ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2'))  \n  .filterDate(startDate, endDate)\n  .filterBounds(sanPedro)\n  // Filter by paths and rows to return minimum images for full coverage\n  .filter(ee.Filter.or(\n    ee.Filter.and(\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_PATH', 35),\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_ROW', 37)),\n    ee.Filter.and(\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_PATH', 35),\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_ROW', 38)),\n    ee.Filter.and(\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_PATH', 36),\n      ee.Filter.eq('WRS_ROW', 37))))\n  .sort('system:time_start')  // Sort by date\n  // .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUD_COVER', cloudFilter));\n  .map(landsatFunctions.renameL8)  // Rename bands\n  \nprint('Landsat Collection', landsat);\nMap.addLayer(ee.Image().byte().paint(landsat.limit(3),\n 'blue', 1), {}, 'Landsat')\n\n\nlandsat = landsat.map(landsatFunctions.addMask)\n\nvar NDVI = landsat.map(function(img) {\n  var ndvi = img.normalizedDifference(['NIR', 'RED'])\n    .rename('ndvi');\n  \n  return img.addBands(ndvi)\n})\n\nMap.addLayer(NDVI.select('ndvi').limit(3), {\n  min: 0,\n  max: 0.4,\n  palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']\n}, 'NDVI', false)\n\nvar meanNDVI = NDVI.select('ndvi').mean()\n\nmeanNDVI = meanNDVI.clip(sanPedro);\n\nprint('Mean NDVI', meanNDVI)\nMap.addLayer(meanNDVI, {\n  min: 0,\n  max: 0.3,\n  palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']\n}, 'Mean NDVI')\n\nExport.image.toDrive({\n  image: meanNDVI, \n  description: 'SanPedroNDVI_10yrMean',\n  folder: 'ATUR/Data',\n  fileNamePrefix: 'SanPedroNDVI_10yrMean',\n  region: sanPedro,\n  scale: 30,\n  crs: 'EPSG:32612'\n})\n```\n\n![San Pedro 10-year mean NDVI.](images/SanPedro_NDVI.png){#fig-ndvi}\n\n#### Land use/land cover\nInfiltration and runoff rates are highly influenced by land cover (**CITATION NEEDED**). ESRI 2020 Global Land Use Land Cover from Sentinel-2 (ESRI LULC) is a 10-m resolution global land cover dataset derived from proprietary machine-learning algorithm run on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (**DATA CITATION**). ESRI LULC was accessed and clipped to the study area using Google Earth Engine. The pixel resolution was reduced to 30 m.\n\n```default\n// Land Use Land Cover\n// Travis Zalesky\n// ATUR\n// 11/14/24\n\nvar studyArea = ee.FeatureCollection(\"projects/ee-travisz09/assets/ATUR/WBDHU8_OuterBoundary_Project\");\n\nvar esri_lulc10 = ee.ImageCollection(\"projects/sat-io/open-datasets/landcover/ESRI_Global-LULC_10m\")\n  .filterBounds(studyArea)\n  .mosaic()\n  .clip(studyArea);\n  \nprint(esri_lulc10)\n\nExport.image.toDrive({\n  image: esri_lulc10, \n  description: 'ESRI_LULC_10m_mergedClipped',\n  folder: 'ATUR/Data',\n  fileNamePrefix: 'ESRI_LULC_10m_clip',\n  region: studyArea,\n  scale: 30,\n  crs: 'EPSG:32612',\n  maxPixels: 1e12\n})\n```\n\n#### Stormwater Drainage Density\n\n**I am unaware of any data availability for this layer.
